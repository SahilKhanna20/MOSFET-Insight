# MOSFET-Insight
This project models the DC and transient behavior of a CMOS inverter using neural networks and LSTM. It predicts Vout based on parameters like Vdd, Vin, Vtn, W/L ratios, and simulates transient response under capacitive loads. Key operations include: DC Analysis,Transient Analysis, Dataset Generation, Critical Voltage Calculation and Visualization.
